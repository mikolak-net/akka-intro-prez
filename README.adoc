= Introduction to Akka presentation

== Description

This repo contains a short (~30 mins, went a bit over the target) presentation aiming to describe the basic concepts of the http://akka.io[Akka] actor core.

== Usage

To presentation is contained in `prez.adoc`, an Asciidoc file intended to be run over the http://asciidoc.org/slidy.html[slidy backend], like so:

     asciidoc --backend=slidy prez.adoc
     
and view `prez.html`. There are two references to the apps in the `demo` projects in the slides, should be pretty straightforward to figure out.

You can also view the raw text of `prez.adoc`, which contains notes for the presentation as comments.
